A custom discord bot specialized for my personal discord.

This really isn't a bot I'd recommend adding.
I started this bot when I had little skills in Python.


# Features:
- Social Points:
Give and take social points from other people, this is very easily exploitable.
- Horse:
I have no words other than this is the single dumbest thing I've ever made, and its awesome.
You have a chance to win a horse, and a chance to lose a horse...
The person with the highest horse count gets the "Stable Master" role on the server.
- Daily Horse Rolls:
Every day at 12 am (host's time) a daily roll for a horse resets.
Gotta boost that engagement somehow, even if it's artificial.
- Shoop:
A custom built place to spend your social points.
Its really shrimple to add new items in the shoops because its all in one big JSON file.
- Data Loading and Saving:
This bot keeps track of every user's data and stores it in JSON.

Other than all that, this bot has really not much else to it.
It isn't really versitile, and I think it isn't all that great to begin with.
But hey, if you wanna try it, just copy my code.


# Usage
My code can be freely adapted and used.
Just give me a social point.
